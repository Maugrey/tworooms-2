#Two Rooms
Two rooms is a mobile adaptation of the card game "Two Rooms and a Boom!" It was built as a hobby project and a way for me to familiarize myself with the Meteor framework. Suggestions on ways I could improve my code are most welcome. If you'd like to try out the app, it's currently hosted at [tworoomsapp.com](http://tworoomsapp.com).

##Disclaimer
Two rooms and a boom was designed by Alan Gerding and Sean McCoy, and is currently published by [Tuesday Knight Games](http://tuesdayknightgames.com/tworoomsandaboom/). This is an unofficial fan project, and is not endorsed in any way by the original creators.
